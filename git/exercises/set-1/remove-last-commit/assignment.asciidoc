We accidentally committed a file `password.txt` that contains our password!
Undo this last commit completely.

* The last commit must be removed altogether from master's history.
* Remove all traces of the last commit from the reflog.
* `password.txt` must be removed from both the staging area and working area.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Realize that this is still not enough to ensure `password.txt` has been removed from the repository.
It's very hard to know for sure it's really gone.

The only way I would personally trust is to completely start over with a new repository.
