You are interested in all versions of `file.txt` in the given repo.
Fetch every version and put it in files named `file-N.txt` where `N` represents the Nth version, starting at 1.

Say there have been made 20 changes to `file.txt` during the repo's lifetime.

* Look for the oldest commit involving `file.txt`.
  Ask the contents of `file.txt` in that commit and write it to `file-1.txt`.
* Then look for the second oldest commit involving `file.txt` and write the contents of that version to `file-2.txt`.
* And so on until the end.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The repo contains commits that do not involve `file.txt`.
These commits should be ignored.
