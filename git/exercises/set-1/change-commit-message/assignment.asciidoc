= Assignment

You are given a repo `sandbox` in which someone added a file `a.txt` but committed it with a wrong message.
He intended to write `added a.txt` but instead wrote `added q.txt`.

Fix this mistake using a single command that allows you to directly rewrite a commit message.
In other words, don't undo and redo the last commit, but instead _modify_ it.
