# Assignment

The directory `sandbox` (which does _not_ contain a Git repository) contains a subdirectory `local` (which _does_ contain a Git repository).

* Create a second (bare) repository under `sandbox/remote`.
* In ``local``, add ``remote`` as a remote and name it `origin`.
* Push ``local``'s `master` branch to the repository in ``remote``.
* Inside `local`, make sure its `master` branch tracks `origin/master`.
