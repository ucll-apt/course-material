Find out who has the most commits on their name in the master branch.
Write the name (e.g., Alex) in a file 'prolific.txt' located the repository root.
You can assume there's no tie.

You will need some help from commands other than Git to solve this problem.

[NOTE]
====
Okay, it's Alex.
That's who's got the most commits.

But, simply writing `echo Alex > prolific.txt` will net you zero points.
Your commands should work on any repository.
