= Assignment

The repo contains two branches: `master` and `feature`.
`feature` branched off of `master` at the second commit and it added a number of commits of its own.

*---* master
    |
    *---*---*---*--- ... ---*---*---*---* feature
                            ^       ^
----

The fourth last and second last commits of the `feature` branch (indicated by `^`) are important.
We want to copy the changes made by those commits to `master`.

`master` should be extended by two commits:

* The first new commit must apply the same changes as the fourth last commit of `feature`.
* The second new commit must apply the same changes as the second last commit of `feature`.
