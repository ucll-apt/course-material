= Assignment

Write a generator `play()` that implements an AI for the game higher-lower.
The goal of this game is to guess a secret number (chosen by the player).

The interaction with this AI should go as follows:

[source,language='python']
----
# Our secret number is 43

# Create the AI
ai = play()

# Ask for first guess
next(ai)   # returns 50

# Tell the AI our secret number is lower using send.
# This also immediately returns the AI's next guess, 25.
ai.send('lower')   # returns 25

# Tell the AI to guess higher.
ai.send('higher')  # return 37

# Tell the AI to guess higher.
ai.send('higher')  # return 43

# The AI's last guess was correct.
----

Your AI must be able to guess all possible numbers ranging from `1` to `100` using a maximum of 6 guesses for each number.
