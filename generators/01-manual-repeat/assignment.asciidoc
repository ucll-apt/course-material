Create a class `Repeat` that can be used in the following way:

[source,language='python']
----
iterator = Repeat(5)

print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
# goes on at infinitum
----

Implement `Repeat` without relying on generators.
In other words, you must manually define a `__next__` method.
