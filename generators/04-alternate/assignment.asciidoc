Create a generator `alternate` that receives two iterators and merges them into a single iterable by alternating between both:

----
xs = iter([1, 2, 3])
ys = iter(['a', 'b', 'c'])

iterator = alternate(xs, ys)

print(next(iterator))  # 1
print(next(iterator))  # 'a'
print(next(iterator))  # 2
print(next(iterator))  # 'b'
print(next(iterator))  # 3
print(next(iterator))  # 'c'
print(next(iterator))  # StopIteration
