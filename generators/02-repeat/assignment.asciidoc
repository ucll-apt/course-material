Create a generator `repeat` that can be used in the following way:

[source,language='python']
----
iterator = repeat(5)

print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
print(next(iterator))   # 5
# goes on at infinitum
----

[NOTE]
====
`repeat` already exists in `itertools`.
It speaks for itself you should implement your own version here, but in the future, please make use of the library implementation.
