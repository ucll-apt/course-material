= Assignment

We're making a sudoku solver.
A single cell contains a number ranging from `1` to `9`.
At first, we don't know which number, so we simply list all possibilities in an array: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`.
As the solving goes on, we can eliminate certain numbers from this list.
A cell is solved when only one number remains.

Add typing to the following function, which removes a number `n` from an array `ns`:

[source,language='javascript']
----
function remove(ns, n)
{
    return ns.filter(x => x !== n);
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The numbers in `ns` and `n` should range between `1` and `9`.
In other words, the compiler should prevent you from passing any other number.

[TIP]
====
You will need to combine union types and literal types.
