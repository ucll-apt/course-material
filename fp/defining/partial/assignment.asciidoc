Say you have a function

[source,language='javascript']
----
function write_to_log(path, message)
{
    // Appends message to file with given path
}
----

You will typically always log to the same file, meaning you'll always have to specify the same `path` argument.

[source,language='javascript']
----
const LOG_PATH = "...";

write_to_log(LOG_PATH, "some message");
----

To avoid this repetition, it is preferable to create a separate function:

[source,language='javascript']
----
function log(message)
{
    write_to_log(LOG_PATH, message);
}
----

This pattern of having to call a function with the same parameter occurs often.
(For example, dependency injection fits this pattern.)

Write a function `partial` that can be used to automate this process.

[source,language='javascript']
----
const log = partial(write_to_log, LOG_PATH);
----

It is important to understand that `log(x)` is short for `write_to_log(LOG_PATH, x)`.
In other words, `partial` allows us to "partially" call a function: we only specify the first parameter, the remaining parameters can be given later.
In general, we can write

[source,language='javascript']
----
const g = partial(f, x);

g(a, b, c) // same as f(x, a, b, c)
----
